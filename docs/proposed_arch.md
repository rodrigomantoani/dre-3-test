## New Airflow Architecture with Enhancements Proposal for Deployment on AWS

This architecture is designed to deploy Apache Airflow on AWS using production-grade, scalable, and secure components. The design is focused on optimizing resource utilization, enhancing monitoring, securing communication, and enabling event-driven workflows. Below are the key components of the architecture:

### Architecture Components:

1. **Route 53:**
    - AWS Route 53 is used to manage DNS and provide a reliable domain name for the Airflow Web UI.

2. **AWS Application Load Balancer:**
    - Distributes traffic between the different components of Airflow (WebServer, Scheduler, Workers) running within an Amazon EKS cluster.
    - Ensures that the traffic is balanced and handles HTTPS termination for secure communication.

3. **Airflow Scheduler (EKS Pod):**
    - Managed as a pod within Amazon EKS.
    - Responsible for scheduling and triggering tasks within DAGs.

4. **Airflow Worker (EKS Pods):**
    - Deployed as Kubernetes pods within the EKS cluster.
    - The worker pods are dynamically scaled based on the workload using the KubernetesExecutor, improving scalability and resource management.

5. **Airflow WebServer (EKS Pod):**
    - The web interface for managing and monitoring DAGs.
    - Deployed within EKS as a pod.

6. **Redis (Elasticache):**
    - Redis is used as a message broker for Celery workers.
    - Also functions as a DAG cache to reduce the parsing load and improve performance.

7. **PostgreSQL (RDS):**
    - Amazon RDS manages the Airflow metadata database using PostgreSQL with high availability and encryption for secure data management.

8. **S3 Bucket (DAGs, Logs, Plugins):**
    - Stores DAG definitions, logs, and plugins in a centralized location.
    - Supports versioning to track changes and rollback if necessary.

9. **HashiCorp Vault:**
    - Externalized configuration management for securely storing secrets and environment variables.
    - Ensures sensitive data, such as credentials and API keys, are stored securely.

10. **CloudWatch / Prometheus / Grafana:**
    - Centralized monitoring and logging services.
    - Prometheus collects detailed metrics, and Grafana provides visualizations and dashboards for monitoring the performance of the Airflow components.
    - CloudWatch manages logs and provides alerting integration with PagerDuty or Slack for real-time incident management.

11. **Apache Kafka / AWS EventBridge:**
    - Event-driven architecture to trigger DAGs based on external events.
    - Provides integration with Apache Kafka or AWS EventBridge for real-time data streams and event-driven workflows.

### Key Enhancements:

- **Auto-Scaling for Workers:**
    - The architecture leverages KubernetesExecutor for dynamic scaling of worker pods, ensuring that the system can handle variable workloads efficiently.

- **Improved Monitoring and Alerting:**
    - The integration of Prometheus, Grafana, and CloudWatch enhances monitoring capabilities, while alerting with PagerDuty or Slack allows for proactive incident response.

- **DAG Parsing Optimization:**
    - Redis serves as a cache for parsed DAGs, reducing the load on the WebServer and improving overall system performance.

- **Secure Communication:**
    - All internal communication between components (e.g., WebServer, Workers, Redis, PostgreSQL) is secured with SSL/TLS, ensuring data privacy and protection in production environments.

- **Event-Driven Architecture:**
    - The use of Apache Kafka or AWS EventBridge allows DAGs to be triggered by external events, providing flexibility beyond time-based scheduling.

- **Externalized Configuration:**
    - By utilizing HashiCorp Vault, the architecture ensures that sensitive configuration data is managed securely and centrally.
